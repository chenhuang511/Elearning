Hello moodle user,

In the instructions below, MOODLE_HOME is the path to where your Moodle is
deployed in your server.

To install this plugin:

1- Upload/unpack everything under:
MOODLE_HOME/auth/loginlogoutredir

NOTE 1: You have to create the 'loginlogoutredir' folder.

NOTE 2: if the package you got the files from put them within a folder of its own,
remove the files from that folder. For example, there should *NOT* be a "moodle-auth_loginlogoutredir"
folder under "MOODLE_HOME/auth/loginlogoutredir".

2- Add two entries to your config.php:
$CFG->loginredir = "{$CFG->wwwroot}/plus/some/different/path"
$CFG->logoutredir = "Any URL you want"

NOTE 1: Core Moodle will only accept to redirect if the URL begins with what's in $CFG->wwwroot.

3- Login to Moodle with your admin account.

4- Go to:
Site Administration --> Plugins --> Authentication --> Manage Authentication

5- Enable "Login/Logout user redirection".

6- Save changes

7- Try it out!
